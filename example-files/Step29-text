##### Section 8 | Step 29 - Overview of connecting RESTful service to JPA

In this and the subsequent steps we will add JPA to our RESTful web services application. What we'll do over the next
few steps is, we'll take this user and we'll actually make it something which is an entity managed by JPA and we will
also create different user resources.

We'll take this user resource and step by step convert it to use JPA instead of  using the userDAOService which is
actually an static array list, we'll change that from this list to make it talk to a database. We'll have a new thing
called userRepository which is created which would be the one talking to the database.
