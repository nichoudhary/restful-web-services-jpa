##### Section 8 | Step 31 - Updating GET Methods on User Resource to use JPA

In this step, we want to create a service to retrieve all users. Right now we have the user resource which is talking
to the in-memory list. We would want to make it talk to the embedded DB. Instead of modifying the User Resource we'll
copy it as UserJPAResource and here we'll convert the DAOService to Repository.


##### Section 8 | Step 32 - Updating POST and DELETE Methods on User Resource to use JPA

In the last step, we converted the retrieve/get methods to use JPA. In this step, let's quickly convert the delete and
create user methods also to be able to use JPA.

Due to our test data in data.sql file, when we execute a create user request it would get
->org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement, it is due to that fact after
the program starts, hibernate creates a sequence for primary key id starting with 1. And when it tries to insert user
with id=1 while executing the create user request, it will show exception because id=1 is already present due to our
test data. Hence we'll change ids of our test data to 1001, 1002, 1003 to avoid conflict.
