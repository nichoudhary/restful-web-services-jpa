##### Section 6 | Step 28 - Monitoring APIs with Spring Boot

We'd want to monitor our service. If our service is failing or application is down, we'd want to know as quickly as possible. We'd want to
build monitoring around all our APIs, especially when we move into micro-services architectures where apps are built with a number of
small micro-services. It is very important to have great monitoring around your apps and Spring boot has great support to provide all this
monitoring very easily. For this we'd need a few dependencies to be added, where one of them is -> spring-boot-starter-actuator. And what
we'd also be able to do is to look at the services which are provided by actuator in a browser.
For this we'll add -> spring-data-rest-hal-browser

HAL (Hypertext Application Language) is a specific format. It is a simple format to specify how to hyperlink between your resources in
your API. The Spring boot actuator APIs are actually are in HAL format. So, what the HAL browser does, it looks into those APIs, identifies
the links and choose them and shows them on the screen so that you can easily browse through the APIs by just clicking the links in there.
The HAL browser makes it easy to consume the services which are exposed by Spring Boot Actuator.

After adding the dependencies, re-start the application. One of the important things is, the actuator URLs are changing with the spring boot releases.
-> http://localhost:8080/actuator
-> http://localhost:8080/application

We can see the actuator up and running on the above url. Also, there are a lot of other things the actuator provides, to enable that we
need to configure a property in application.properties file.
-> management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
In here, we are enabling the web exposure -> the exposure over http of the all the management endpoints. One other things to consider,
when we enable a lot of tracking / auditing / monitoring -> there would be a performance impact. One of the recommendation is to
identify which of the things we want and to enable only those. Other option is to disable it in production and only use it in test env.

Now if we restart and go to actuator endpoint, we'll see a lot of things. To browse through HAL browser goto-> http://localhost:8080
We can use the HAL browser to browse through the actuator. Goto HAL browser, the explorer type in /actuator and we can see all the
things related to actuator in there.

To make the below dependencies work -
        <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-browser</artifactId>
			<version>3.3.9.RELEASE</version>
		</dependency>

We need to disable everything related to SWAGGER staring from dependencies to code. For some reason Swagger and actuator are not working
maybe due version incompatibility or something.
