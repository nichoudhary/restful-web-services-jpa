##### Section 8 | Step 30 - Creating User Entity and some Test Data

In this step, let's create user entity and user repository so that we can access the details of the user. While working
on JPA, we want to keep things simple, hence we'll disable security.

One other thing we also want to is we want to enable something called H2 console in the application.properties file so
that we can see the data inside the table. Also enable show-SQL to see the sql generated in the logs.

To goto h2-console => http://localhost:8080/h2-console
DB url = jdbc:h2:mem:testdb -> this is to set the db url instead of using randomly generated value from logs

We can see in the logs the structure of the created table -
// create table user (id integer not null, birth_date timestamp, name varchar(255), primary key (id))

Now, the first thing we'd want to do is to populate some data in the user table of the database. We can do that by creating
a sql file in the resources folder. And then re-start the service.

Since we're using Spring Boot version >= 2.5.0 Release, the application will fail to start, hence we need to add this
in application.properties -> spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
